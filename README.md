# 30 Days of Python Challenge 🐍

I am participating in the [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) challenge by Asabeneh. 
This repository serves as a diary of my progress, code snippets, and projects as I master Python from the ground up, with a focus on **AI and Machine Learning development.**

## 🚀 My Goal
My objective is to build a strong foundation in Python to **develop interactive AI and Machine Learning models.**

## 📅 Progress Tracker
| Day | Topic | Key Project/Script | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Day 01 | Introduction & Basics | `hello_world.py` | ✅ Complete |
| Day 02 | Variables & Built-in Functions | `variables.py` | ✅ Complete |
| Day 03 | Operators | - | 🏃 In Progress |

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Building
- **Core:** Data Types, Built-in Functions, Variables
- **AI Foundations:** Mathematical Operations, Data Structures
- **Advanced:** (Planned) File Handling, Web Scraping, API Integration
- **Frameworks:** (Planned) Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
